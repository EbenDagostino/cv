        <p><em><strong>2022 Graduate</strong></em></p>
        <p>Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. Currently I am pursuing a higher education at Colorado State University in Computer Science with a specialization in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
      I love writing code. Ever since I wrote my first program, as simple as it was, getting my computer to say 'Hello Eben' as I went through the BASIC tutorial it was almost like magic. Learning the ins and outs of Python had me hooked. The challenge and complexity that comes with manipulating a computer to solve practical problems drives me to continue learning. It's like a never ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving.
      I am interested in the software engineering field and am seeking exciting entry level opportunities related to the same. </p></td>
